# Simon: The Game of Memory

"Simon" was an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device created a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence (via https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game))

I created a 'hard mode' - that also has the simon board spin. There currently is no end to the game - but see if you can beat the high score!

This version of the game I coded almost completely from scratch aside from:

> SVG code to create the Board from:

>
> Rotate Div Code from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6410730/css-endless-rotation-animation
>
> Speech Synthesis Script from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15653145/using-google-text-to-speech-in-javascript

Current known problems:

- High Score not functioning
- Computer turn colors are too fast
- No visual message upon losing
